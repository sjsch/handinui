A UI for UBC CS/ECE's command-line "handin" program.  Normally, a
student would zip up their code, `scp` it onto the ECE server, then
unzip, `chmod 700` it, and invoke `handin` on it.  This program
automates that entire process behind a nice UI.

## Code Quality

It's horrible because I hacked this together during a lecture I wasn't
listening to.  I won't fix it because I don't care (though do report
bugs, I will try to fix those).
